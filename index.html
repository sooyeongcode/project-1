            <h2>“I've so enjoyed working with Soo Yeong; she is a self-starter and full of initiative with minimal direction. It was helpful when we had tight deadlines on specific tasks. Also, what I learned from Soo Yeong is that when she wants to follow up on tasks, she takes a great approach to convince that we are aligned.”</h2>

        <h2>“Soo Yeong, worked with Tazapay as a UX designer for 3 months. Tazapay is a venture backed Fintech startup. As a company we obsess over UX and experience. She helped us with the overall UX and also with marketing related work. She is very diligent and hard working. She has attention for detail and takes a lot of pride in her work. She understands the end customers mindset and has high degree of empathy for the customer. We were happy with the quality of her work and the output. I am happy to recommend her for any design related role.”</h2>
        <h2>“Soo Yeong came to me to join barePack's journey from her heart: our vision was something that drove her to us and I could not be more grateful that it did. During her time interning with us, she has proven to be a valuable team member; whether it be working on short deadlines around our Deliveroo "deposit" feature, conducting usability interviews, optimizing our web platforms, lead generation sources, and subscriber/user workflows, spontaneously suggesting A/B UI versions, gathering feedback to present it in a way that helped determine new changes or organise a new UI set of components on Figma (and the list goes on), Soo Yeong brought with her a positive can-do attitude to everything she did. No task was ever too big or small, and she delivered work with consistency and reliability. Our product manager would agree that there was never a need to follow up on tasks, because Soo Yeong would always beat us to it, asking for permission to move on to the next step or task.I wish Soo Yeong the best continuation - it would be a privilege for anyone to count her among their team for sure. Thank you Soo Yeong, you've made meaningful impact on helping us provide a kinder way to takeaway.”</h2>
